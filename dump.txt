1. add intersections of online gaming and carla and physics and maths (research topics)
2. commercial games that simulate urban environments at high fidelity, such as Grand Theft Auto V 
3. We use CARLA to study the performance of three approaches to autonomous driving.
- The first is a classic modular pipeline that comprises a vision-based perception module, a rule-based planner, and a maneuver controller.
- The second is a deep network that maps sensory input to driving commands, trained end-to-end via imitation learning.
-  The third is also a deep network, trained end-to-end via reinforcement learning. 
4. CARLA is designed as a server-client system, where the server runs the simulation and renders the scene. 
- The client API is implemented in Python and is responsible for the interaction between the autonomous agent and the server via sockets. 
- The client sends commands and meta-commands to the server and receives sensor readings in return.
- Commands control the vehicle and include steering, accelerating, and braking. 
- Metacommands control the behavior of the server and are used for resetting the simulation, changing the properties of the environment, and modifying the sensor suite. 
- Environmental properties include weather conditions, illumination, and density of cars and pedestrians. 
- When the server is reset, the agent is re-initialized at a new location specified by the client.
5. Pedestrians navigate the streets according to a town-specific navigation map, which conveys a location-based cost. This cost is designed to encourage pedestrians to walk along sidewalks and marked road crossings, but allows them to cross roads at any point.
6.  If a car collides with a pedestrian, the pedestrian is deleted from the simulation and a new pedestrian is spawned at a different location after a brief time interval.
7. pseudo-sensor provides 12 semantic classes: road, lane-marking, traffic sign, sidewalk, fence, pole, wall, building, vegetation, vehicle, pedestrian, and other.
8. This planner takes the current position of the agent and the location of the goal as input, and uses the A∗ algorithm to provide a high-level plan that the agent needs to follow in order to reach the goal.
